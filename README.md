# Django Guide

A comprehensive guide to help scale Django web applications. We hope that this guide would be useful as a reference as you build and scale your Django application.

You will find this guide useful if you are:
- Learning how to scale and identify bottlenecks in your Django application
- Working on your first Django project (with or without prior experience in developing web applications in other languages or frameworks)

## Getting Started With Django

If you are looking to learn Django or are unfamiliar with the basics, we strongly recommend you to work through the [Django tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/intro/tutorial01/). The tutorial is relatively short and can be completed within a day if you have
prior web development experience with other languages or frameworks.

For a more detailed introduction, you may wish to work through the [Django Girls Tutorial](http://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/) which covers the same material as they do during their workshops.
